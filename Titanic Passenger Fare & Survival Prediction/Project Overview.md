## Project Overview
This will be a semester-long individual project. You will primarily be working on one data set throughout the semester.

We recommend teams of 3 students, while teams sizes of 1 or 2 are also acceptable. The team size will be taken under consideration when evaluating the quality of the project, meaning that a three-person team is expected to accomplish more than a one-person team would. Students should submit their final reports in groups. You are free to team up by yourself.

You will use the various machine learning methods from class to work on the prediction problems. There will be a number of milestones due throughout the semester to guide you along with your project. Doing each milestone well will make the end of the project a lot smoother for you!
