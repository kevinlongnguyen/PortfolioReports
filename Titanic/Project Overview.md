## Project Overview
This will be a semester-long individual project. You will primarily be working on one data set throughout the semester.

We recommend teams of 3 students, while teams sizes of 1 or 2 are also acceptable. The team size will be taken under consideration when evaluating the quality of the project, meaning that a three-person team is expected to accomplish more than a one-person team would. Students should submit their final reports in groups. You are free to team up by yourself.

You will use the various machine learning methods from class to work on the prediction problems. There will be a number of milestones due throughout the semester to guide you along with your project. Doing each milestone well will make the end of the project a lot smoother for you!

### Milestone 0: Forming the team

Start to form the team, up to 3 team members; check available students and their email addresses on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yR-DYWYQeV0xtS4Ny3smQrfOxBIa1V5qbBNn8qGoHTE/edit?usp=sharing
Once you form the team, please also indicate your team's name on the above google sheet. 
We encourage a diverse group and outreach for students you don't know before.

### Milestone 1: Searching for data (due March 16, 11:59 pm)

In this semester-long project, you are expected to find a dataset, which is well-motivated to work on regression and classification problems.

Write a one-page summary introducing the background, prediction problems, and data structure. (the summary is limited to one page, 12pt font size, 1-inch margin, and single space.)

The regression problem is based on the numerical output, and the classification problem is based on categorical output.

Submit your report through Assignments on Collab.

### Milestone 2 (Data analyzing based on linear methods, due April 7, 11:59 pm)

Use linear method to conduct the regression and classification problems, separately
Split the data into a training set and testing set;  use training data to estimate the model and select tuning parameters; use testing data to evaluate the prediction performance
Choose a naive method as the benchmark (for example, use the sample mean as the predictor); and compare its performance with linear methods
State clearly how to choose the tuning parameters
Summarize your results into the one-page report (12pt font size, 1-inch margin, and single space); additional tables and figures can be listed on another page. 
Submit your report through Assignments on Collab.

### Milestone 3 (Data analyzing based on nonlinear methods, due April 28, 11:59 pm)

Use nonlinear method to conduct the regression and classification problems, separately
Split the data into a training set and testing set;  use training data to estimate the model and select tuning parameters; use testing data to evaluate the prediction performance
Compare nonlinear methods' performance with linear methods
State clearly how to choose the tuning parameters
Summarize your results into the one-page report (12pt font size, 1-inch margin, and single space); additional tables and figures can be listed on another page. 
Submit your report & Code through Assignments on Collab.

### Milestone 4 (Oral Exam, May 3rd 3:30 -- 4:45 pm and May 5th 9:00 -- 12:00 am)

1. Final Grade 70% reports from previous milestones + 30% oral exam
2. Oral exam: May 3rd and May 5th. Each team will prepare a speed presentation of ~ 5 mins; it should include an introduction of the problem, a description of methods and results, and a summary and discussion of your work and future work. After the presentation, the audience will have related questions, and each of the team members will take turns answering questions. Please note we encourage you to ask questions to other teams; one-third of the additional credits come from this part. This part is mainly checking individual performance.
